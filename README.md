# 🚌 e-Bus Pass Application

The **e-Bus Pass App** is a full-stack web application that digitalizes the process of applying, approving, and managing bus passes for students.  
It provides **two roles**: **Client (Students)** and **Admin**.  
Built with **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Express.js**, and **Stripe**, it ensures a smooth, secure, and paperless experience.
